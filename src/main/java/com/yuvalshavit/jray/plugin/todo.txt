- "collapse" anonymous classes; that is, their relationship is actually of their enclosing class
- collapse private inner/nested classes, or package-private inner/nested classes with some annotation.
  (Note: can't use guava's @VisibleForTesting, because it's not retained)
- for both of the above, make sure it collapses all the way up. E.g. an anonymous class within a private class
- enums right now have a self-cycle via builds
- how are generics handled?

Validation:

Graph should take Node and produce Edge; Edge should produce Node and relationship
